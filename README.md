# Gororoba
The initial idea was to create a shared house recipes blog for young people with no experience (and no money) in the kitchen. But over time, I have learned some tricks and so I began to venture into my  mother's cookbook. In time, the blog of gororobas turned into an online cookbook.  Speaking of cookbook, have you noticed that few people still have this habit? I realized that over time, some family recipes have been lost with the arrival of new generations, since no one has more curiosity to unravel the ancient cookbooks. Hence the idea of keeping alive some of the culinary experiences in an interactive and funny way.
